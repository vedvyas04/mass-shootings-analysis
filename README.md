<h1> Mass Shootings Analysis </h1>

<h2> This is my project for Introduction to Data Managment and Processing (DS-5110) at Northeastern University. </h2>

<p> Mass shootings have grabbed attention over the recent years due to their growing numbers and frequency of incidence. 
Studies have shown that mass shootings have increased over the years, and there have been more mass shootings in the United States than any other country. 
The latest mass shooting incidents inspired us to conduct an analysis on this topic with the agenda to find meaningful insights to reduce the mass shootings in US. 
I wanted to dig deeper into the factors and causes leading to more mass shootings in certain regions, and across timeframes. </p>

<p> I have used 3 datasets. Aggregated the first two datas and did data cleaning. 
  Finally, the last dataset about gun control data is used later in the project to see if there is any relation between gun laws and mass shootings. </p>
